Chainrails supports two settlement modes optimized for different transaction sizes and use cases. The mode is automatically selected based on the transaction amount and available routes.

## Settlement Types

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Instant Settlement">
### Instant Settlement (Fast-Fill)

For smaller transfers, Chainrails uses prefunded liquidity to deliver funds on the destination chain immediately—typically within seconds.

**Key Features:**
- **Available for:** Transfers up to **$5,000**
- **Speed:** Instant delivery in seconds
- **How it works:** Funds are prefunded by Chainrails relayers and finalized asynchronously

<Info>
This mode prioritizes speed while maintaining strong reliability guarantees. Funds arrive instantly while the underlying cross-chain settlement happens in the background.

</Tab>
<Tab title="Standard Settlement">
### Standard Settlement

For larger transfers, Chainrails defaults to standard settlement using canonical cross-chain bridges and protocols.

**Key Features:**
- **Used for:** Transfers **above $5,000**
- **Speed:** Settlement time varies by bridge (typically 2-30 minutes)
- **How it works:** Funds settle once the underlying bridge or protocol finalizes

<Warning>
While slightly slower, standard settlement minimizes risk for large amounts by using battle-tested canonical bridges.

## Comparison

| Feature | Instant Settlement | Standard Settlement |
|---------|-------------------|---------------------|
| **Amount Limit** | Up to $5,000 | Above $5,000 |
| **Speed** | Seconds | 10-30 minutes |
| **Mechanism** | Prefunded liquidity | Canonical bridges |
| **Risk Profile** | Low (relayer-backed) | Minimal (protocol-backed) |

## Why This Design?

Instant settlement relies on prefunded liquidity from Chainrails relayers. To ensure reliability and protect users from partial fills or failed transfers, we apply a conservative fast-fill limit.

<Tip>
As Chainrails scales and our relayer network becomes more efficiently decentralized, instant settlement limits will increase to serve larger transactions.

## FAQ

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Can I force standard settlement for amounts under $5,000?">
Currently, Chainrails automatically optimizes for the fastest settlement mode available. For amounts under $5,000, instant settlement is always preferred when available.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What happens if instant settlement liquidity is unavailable?">
If instant settlement isn't available for any reason, your transaction will automatically fall back to standard settlement. You'll be notified of the expected settlement time.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Do settlement modes affect fees?">
No, fees are calculated based on the underlying bridge costs not the settlement mode.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Will instant settlement limits increase?">
Yes! As our relayer network grows and becomes more decentralized, we plan to increase instant settlement limits to support larger transactions.
