<Note>
  You need an API Key to use the Chainrails SDK. You can get one by signing up on our [dashboard](https://dashboard.chainrails.io) or contacting us at contact@horuslabs.co.
</Note>

## Overview

The Chainrails SDK (`@chainrails/sdk`) is a TypeScript SDK that provides a simple, type-safe interface for interacting with the Chainrails API. It handles authentication, request formatting, and error handling automatically, allowing you to focus on building your application.

## Installation

<Tab title="pnpm">
```bash
pnpm add @chainrails/sdk
```
</Tab>
<Tab title="yarn">
```bash

## SDK Modules

The SDK is organized into the following modules:

### [Intents](/sdk-reference/intents)
Create and manage cross-chain transfer intents, track payment status, and retrieve intent information.

### [Router](/sdk-reference/router)
Find optimal routes and analyze bridge availability for cross-chain transfers.

### [Quotes](/sdk-reference/quotes)
Get real-time quotes for cross-chain transfers from various bridge providers.

### [Chains](/sdk-reference/chains)
Retrieve information about supported blockchain networks and tokens.

### [Client](/sdk-reference/client)
Retrieve authenticated client information.

## Language Support

<Tip>
Currently, the SDK is available for **TypeScript/JavaScript**
</Tip>

## Authentication

The SDK uses API key-based authentication. Configure your API key once at startup:

```typescript
import { Chainrails } from "@chainrails/sdk"

Chainrails.config({
  api_key: process.env.CHAINRAILS_API_KEY
})
```

The API key is automatically included in all requests via the `Authorization: Bearer` header.

## Error Handling

The SDK throws errors for failed requests. Wrap SDK calls in try-catch blocks:

```typescript
try {
  const intent = await crapi.intents.create({...})
} catch (error) {
  if (error instanceof Error) {
    console.error("Failed to create intent:", error.message)
  }
}
```

### Retry Policy

The SDK automatically retries failed requests up to 2 times.

## Type Definitions

The SDK includes full TypeScript type definitions for all requests and responses, providing autocomplete and type safety in your IDE.
