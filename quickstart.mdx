## Get started in three steps

The quickest way to get started with Chainrails is through our SDKs. Follow the steps below to start accepting payments/deposits in under 10 minutes.

### Step 1: Installation
Begin by installing the Chainrails SDK.

```bash
npm install @chainrails/sdk
```

### Step 2: Initialize the Payment Modal
Import and initialize the Chainrails payment modal in your application.

```javascript
import { chains, tokens, PaymentModal, usePaymentModal } from "@chainrails-sdk/react"

function App() {
  const cr = usePaymentModal({
    to: "0x4F41BCf288E718A36c1e6919c2Dfc2E07d51c675",
    amount: 1,
    chain: chains.BASE,
    token: tokens.USDC,
    onCancel: () => {
      console.log("Payment Cancelled")
    },
    onSuccess: () => {
      console.log("Payment Successful")
    }
  })

  return (
    <div>
      <button onClick={cr.open} className="border my-4 py-2 px-4 cursor-pointer">
        Open Modal
      </button>
      <PaymentModal config={config} {...cr} />
    </div>
  )
}
```

Where:
- `to`: Your wallet address to receive payments/deposits.
- `amount`: The amount to be paid/deposited.
- `chain`: The blockchain network to accept payments from.
- `token`: The token/currency to accept payments in.

And voila! You are now ready to accept your first payment.
