## Overview

Every Chainrails transaction follows three simple steps from setup to completion:

#### Request a Quote

Define the parameters for the transaction (the intent) — amount, source chain, source token, destination chain, recipient, and refund address.
This tells Chainrails what the user wants to send and where it’s going.

#### Generate an Intent Address

Once the quote is confirmed, Chainrails creates a unique intent address for that transaction.
Think of this as a one-time deposit address that tracks and processes the transfer logic automatically.

#### Fund the Intent

The user then funds this intent address directly from their wallet.
Once funded, Chainrails takes care of the rest — executing the cross-chain transfer, routing liquidity, and confirming settlement.

The SDK abstracts most of these steps, so you can integrate this entire flow in just a few lines of code.
In this Quickstart, we’ll walk you through how to get up and running in minutes.

## Get started in three steps

<Steps>
<Step title="Installation">
Begin by installing the Chainrails React SDK.

```bash
npm install @chainrails/react @chainrails/sdk
```

</Step>

<Step title="Set up a Session Endpoint">
Create a backend endpoint that generates secure session tokens. This protects your API key and prevents abuse.

<Note>
  Here's a curated Github template to help you get started quickly: <a href="https://github.com/horuslabsio/chainrails-session-server-demo">Chainrails Demo Server</a>
</Note>

```javascript
import { Chainrails, crapi } from "@chainrails/sdk";

app.get("/create-session", async (req, res) => {
  const api_key = process.env.CHAINRAILS_API_KEY;
  const amount = "100";
  const recipient = "0x...";
  const destinationChain = "BASE";
  const token = "USDC";

  Chainrails.config({
    api_key,
  });

  const session = await crapi.auth.getSessionToken({
    amount: amount,
    recipient: recipient,
    destinationChain: destinationChain,
    token: token,
  });

  res.send(session);
});
````

Where:

- `recipient`: Your wallet address to receive payments/deposits.
- `amount`: The amount to be paid/deposited. Leave empty or set to 0 to allow user input.
- `destinationChain`: The blockchain network to receive payments to.
- `token`: The token/currency you want to receive.
- `amount`: The amount to be paid/deposited. Leave empty or set to 0 to allow user input.
</Step>

<Step title="Initialize the Payment Modal">
Import and initialize the Chainrails payment modal in your application.

```javascript
import { chains, tokens, PaymentModal, usePaymentSession } from "@chainrails/react"

function App() {
  const cr = usePaymentSession({
    session_url: "https://your-server.com/create-session",
    onSuccess: () => {
      console.log("Payment Successful")
    },
  })

  return (
    <div>
      <button onClick={cr.open}>Pay with Crypto</button>
      <PaymentModal {...cr} />
    </div>
  )
}
```

**Parameters:**

- `session_url`: Your server endpoint for creating payment sessions.
</Step>
</Steps>

For more detailed instructions, refer to the [Payment Modal Documentation](/sdk-reference/components/payment-modal).

## What happens next?

When users click the payment button:

1. The SDK fetches a secure session token from your backend
2. Users see the payment modal with their wallet connection options
3. They can pay from any supported chain/token (Chainrails handles bridging)
4. Your `onSuccess` callback fires when the transaction completes
5. Funds arrive in your `recipient` address on your chosen chain
