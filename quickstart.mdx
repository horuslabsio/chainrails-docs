## Overview

Every Chainrails transaction follows three simple steps from setup to completion:

#### Request a Quote

Define the parameters for the transaction (the intent) — amount, source chain, source token, destination chain, recipient, and refund address.
This tells Chainrails what the user wants to send and where it’s going.

#### Generate an Intent Address

Once the quote is confirmed, Chainrails creates a unique intent address for that transaction.
Think of this as a one-time deposit address that tracks and processes the transfer logic automatically.

#### Fund the Intent

The user then funds this intent address directly from their wallet.
Once funded, Chainrails takes care of the rest — executing the cross-chain transfer, routing liquidity, and confirming settlement.

The SDK abstracts most of these steps, so you can integrate this entire flow in just a few lines of code.
In this Quickstart, we’ll walk you through how to get up and running in minutes.

## Get started in three steps

<Steps>
<Step title="Installation">
Begin by installing the Chainrails React SDK.

```bash
npm install @chainrails/react
```

</Step>

<Step title="Set up a Session Endpoint">
  Create a server endpoint that generates session tokens using the Chainrails SDK.
  
```javascript
// Example with Express.js
import { Chainrails, crapi } from "@chainrails/sdk";

app.post("/create-session", async (req, res) => {
const { destinationChain, token, amount, recipient } = req.body;

Chainrails.config({
api_key: process.env.CHAINRAILS_API_KEY,
env: "production",
});

const session = await crapi.auth.getSessionToken({
amount: amount,
recipient: recipient,
destinationChain: destinationChain,
token: token,
});

res.send(session);
});

````

</Step>

<Step title="Initialize the Payment Modal">
Import and initialize the Chainrails payment modal in your application.

```javascript
import { chains, tokens, PaymentModal, usePaymentSession } from "@chainrails/react"

function App() {
  const cr = usePaymentSession({
    session_url: "https://your-server.com/create-session",
    destinationChain: chains.BASE,
    token: tokens.USDC,
    recipient: "0x4F41BCf288E718A36c1e6919c2Dfc2E07d51c675",
    amount: 1, // If you remove the amount value, the user can input their own.
    onCancel: () => {
      console.log("Payment Cancelled")
    },
    onSuccess: () => {
      console.log("Payment Successful")
    },
  })

  return (
    <div>
      <button onClick={cr.open}> Open Modal </button>
      <PaymentModal {...cr} />
    </div>
  )
}
````

Where:

- `session_url`: Your server endpoint for creating payment sessions.
- `recipient`: Your wallet address to receive payments/deposits.
- `amount`: The amount to be paid/deposited. Leave empty or set to 0 to allow user input.
- `destinationChain`: The blockchain network to receive payments to.
- `token`: The token/currency you want to receive.
- `amount`: The amount to be paid/deposited. Leave empty or set to 0 to allow user input.

</Step>
</Steps>

And voila! You are now ready to accept your first payment.
