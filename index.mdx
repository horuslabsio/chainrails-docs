## Why Chainrails?

We built Chainrails to eliminate two of the biggest pain points facing Web3 developers and businesses today: liquidity fragmentation and multichain complexity.

As at November 2025, there are over a thousand distinct blockchains, with more being built every day. Each chain comes with its own unique user base, tokens and liquidity pools. To access these, developers are forced to build complex integrations with multiple blockchains, and constantly maintain them as each chain evolves. This would usually involve either duplicating contract logic across chains, or battling with complex cross-chain bridges and liquidity solutions.

This fragmentation problem shows up in two main ways:
### Needless multichain complexity
 Building and maintaining integrations with multiple blockchains is complex, time-consuming and expensive. Each chain has its own unique architecture, token standards, and developer tools. While some products truly need multichain logic, most applications simply want to accept payments or deposits from users on any chain — without managing 10 different infrastructures. For them, the complexity is unnecessary overhead.

### Token and liquidity fragmentation
 Every blockchain operates its own liquidity silos — a USDC on Ethereum isn’t the same as a USDC on Solana or Avalanche. Why do I have to keep track of USD-ABCDE.. on 15 different chains? Users are forced to juggle multiple wallets and tokens across chains, leading to poor user experiences and lost revenue for businesses.

## The future we're building
Our goal is simple: let developers build where they’re most comfortable, and still reach users everywhere.
With Chainrails, you can deploy on one chain and accept value from any other — without worrying about bridges, swaps, or liquidity fragmentation.
