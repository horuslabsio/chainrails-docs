## Why Chainrails?

Web3 today is fragmented. Every blockchain has its own tokens, liquidity, standards, and user base. As a result, developers who simply want to access liquidity end up fighting two unnecessary battles:

### Multichain integration complexity
 Building and maintaining integrations with multiple blockchains is complex, time-consuming and expensive. Each chain has its own unique architecture, token standards, and developer tools. While some products truly need multichain logic, most apps don’t — they just want to accept deposits/payments from users wherever those users already are without managing 10+ different infrastructures.

### Token and liquidity fragmentation
 Every blockchain operates its own liquidity silos — a USDC on Ethereum isn’t the same as a USDC on Solana or Avalanche. Why do I have to keep track of USD-ABCDE.. on 15 different chains? Users are forced to juggle multiple wallets and tokens across chains, leading to poor user experiences and lost revenue for businesses.

## The future we're building
Chainrails removes this fragmentation.
Build on the chain you prefer — and accept deposits/payments from any chain, in any token, through a single SDK.
No redeployments. No custom bridge logic. No juggling liquidity.

Just one integration that connects your app to users everywhere.
