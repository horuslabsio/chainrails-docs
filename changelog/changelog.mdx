## February 2026

<AccordionGroup>

<Accordion title="Network Expansion: 5 New Chains">

Chainrails now supports 5 additional blockchain networks:

- Polygon
- Optimism (Mainnet + Testnet)
- Monad (Mainnet + Testnet)
- HyperEVM 
- Lisk

**Network Coverage:** Now supporting **11 blockchain networks** across mainnet and testnet environments.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Multi-Token Payment Support: 10 Tokens Across Chains">

Expanded from USDC-only to being able to use 10 different tokens for payment across networks:

**New Tokens:**
- Stablecoins: USDT, DAI, BUSD, EURC
- Native Assets: ETH, WETH, BNB
- Ecosystem Tokens: STRK (Starknet), LORDS

**Token Availability:**
- Ethereum: 8 tokens (USDC, USDT, DAI, BUSD, EURC, ETH, WETH, STRK)
- Arbitrum: 5 tokens (USDC, USDT, DAI, ETH, WETH)
- Base: 5 tokens (USDC, DAI, EURC, ETH, WETH)
- Starknet: 6 tokens (USDC, USDT, DAI, ETH, STRK, LORDS)
- BNB Chain: 6 tokens (USDC, USDT, DAI, BUSD, ETH, BNB)
- And more across all supported chains

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Smart Contract Intents">

Introduced contract-level support for creating and managing intents directly from your smart contracts.

**Key Features:**
- Create intents programmatically from smart contracts
- Manage intent lifecycle on-chain
- Seamless integration with existing contract infrastructure

```Solidity
broadcastId = broadcaster.broadcastIntent(intent, deposits, maxFeeBudget, isLive);
```

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Application Fee System">

Introduced configurable application fees for platforms building on Chainrails.

This enables developers to monetize their integrations while maintaining competitive pricing for users.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="⚠️ Breaking Changes">
Intent creation, quote generation and routing methods now require an additional `amountSymbol` parameter to specify the denomination of the amount being sent (e.g., USDC, DAI, ETH). For quotes in USD, we expect you to set `amountSymbol` to USDC as we maintain a 1:1 peg with USD for internal calculations.

NB: You can quote in a different denomination than the token you want to send. For example, you can set `amountSymbol` to USDC, while sending ETH as `tokenIn`.

## January 2026

<AccordionGroup>

<Accordion title="SDK Updates: v0.2.26 (React) · v0.2.6 (Core) · v0.2.3 (Common)">

- **Chain Filtering**: Added `excludeChains` prop to `PaymentModal` component, allowing you to hide specific chains from the payment options
- **Quote Filtering**: Added `excludeChains` parameter to quote methods (`getAll`, `getFromAllBridges`, `getAllForSession`) to filter out unwanted chains from results

**Usage Example:**

```javascript
import { PaymentModal, chains } from "@chainrails/react";

<PaymentModal {...cr} excludeChains={[chains.BASE_TESTNET, chains.STARKNET_TESTNET]} />
```

**SDK Methods:**

```javascript
const quotes = await crapi.quotes.getAll({
  destinationChain: "ARBITRUM_MAINNET",
  amount: "1.5",
  tokenOut: "0x06eFdBFf2a14a7c8E15944D1F4A48F9F95F663A4",
  excludeChains: "BASE_TESTNET,STARKNET_TESTNET",
});
```
