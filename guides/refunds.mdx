Refunds are an essential part of any payment system, they ensure users never lose funds due to failed or excess transactions.
Chainrails automates the refund process for all cross-chain transfers, making it secure, predictable, and effortless for both developers and users.

## When are refunds triggered?
Refunds can occur in two primary scenarios:

### 1. Failed Transfers

If a cross-chain transfer fails to execute (for example, due to network congestion, insufficient deposit, or unexpected errors), the funds are automatically refunded once the intent expires (typically in 1 hour). This delay ensures that premature refunds aren’t made while a transaction may still be in progress or could be retried.

### 2. Excess Payments

If a user sends more than the required amount for an intent, Chainrails automatically deducts the needed value and refunds the excess back to the sender.

## Predictable Outcomes
Chainrails is designed to protect users from cross-chain risks.
Relayers handle bridge and liquidity risk behind the scenes, meaning users are always guaranteed one of two outcomes:

- Successful settlement — funds arrive on the destination chain, or
- Automatic refund — funds are returned to the sender’s wallet.

In other words, users never lose funds because of failed bridges or liquidity issues.

## ⚠️ Manual Refunds (Rare Cases)

In very rare cases where an intent’s final status cannot be determined automatically (for example, due to an indexer outage), a manual review may be required to process the refund.
If this occurs, please contact our support team with the intent ID and transaction details for assistance.
