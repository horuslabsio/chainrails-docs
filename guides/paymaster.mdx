The Chainrails Paymaster enables you to sponsor protocol fees on behalf of your users, creating a seamless and frictionless payment experience for your application.

## What is a Paymaster?

Each cross-chain transaction on Chainrails incurs protocol fees to cover costs associated with bridges and relayers. These fees are charged in the token being transferred, eliminating the need for users to hold multiple tokens for gas or fees.

**With a Paymaster**, you can:
- Cover protocol fees on behalf of your users
- Remove payment friction and improve conversion rates
- Control your transaction costs with flexible billing options

**Without a Paymaster**, your users will pay the protocol fees directly when making cross-chain transfers.

## Getting Started

### Step 1: Access the Dashboard

Navigate to the [Chainrails Dashboard](https://dashboard.chainrails.io) and go to the **Billing** section.

### Step 2: Choose Your Billing Plan

Chainrails offers three billing options to suit different use cases:

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Free Plan">
**Best for:** Testing and low-volume applications

- Users pay their own protocol fees
- No additional costs to you
- Easy to get started
- Upgrade anytime as you scale

</Tab>
<Tab title="Pay As You Go (PAYG)">
**Best for:** Growing applications with variable transaction volumes

- You pay protocol fees as transactions occur
- Only pay for what you use
- Requires manual balance management
- Real-time usage tracking in the Dashboard

<Warning>
Keep your paymaster balance funded to prevent transaction failures.
</Warning>

</Tab>
<Tab title="Monthly Subscription">
**Best for:** High-volume applications with predictable usage

- Fixed monthly fee with included transaction quota
- No manual paymaster management required
- Automatic overage handling
- Never worry about insufficient balance
- Best value for consistent usage

<Info>
Transactions beyond your monthly quota incur additional fees. View pricing details in the Dashboard.
</Info>

</Tab>
</Tabs>

### Step 3: Enable the Paymaster

Once you select either **PAYG** or **Monthly Subscription**, the Paymaster is automatically enabled for your account. All transactions using your API key will have protocol fees covered.

## Using the Paymaster in Your Application

Once enabled, the Paymaster works automatically—no code changes required. Simply make transactions as usual:

<Tabs>
<Tab title="SDK">
```javascript
import { chains, tokens, PaymentModal, usePaymentModal } from "@chainrails-sdk/react"

function App() {
  const cr = usePaymentModal({
    to: "0x4F41BCf288E718A36c1e6919c2Dfc2E07d51c675",
    amount: "1000000", // 1 USDC
    chain: chains.BASE,
    token: tokens.USDC,
  })

  return <PaymentModal config={config} {...cr} />
}
```
</Tab>
<Tab title="API">
```bash
curl -X POST "https://api.chainrails.io/api/v1/intents" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -d '{
    "sender": "0xdA3ECb2E5362295E2b802669dD47127A61d9Ce54",
    "amount": "1000000",
    "tokenIn": "0x036CbD53842c5426634e7929541eC2318f3dCF7e",
    "source_chain": "BASE_TESTNET",
    "destination_chain": "ARBITRUM_TESTNET",
    "recipient": "0xb79541Be080a59fdcE6C0b43219ba56c725eC65e"
  }'
```
</Tab>
</Tabs>

PS: Ignore the `fees` field as that is returned to track usage, but you would notice the `totalAmount` field would be the same as the amount you are sending.

## FAQ

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="What happens if my PAYG balance runs out?">
Transactions will fail if your paymaster balance is insufficient. Users will see an error and the transaction won't be processed. To avoid this, regularly monitor your balance and top up as needed.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Can I disable the Paymaster temporarily?">
Yes, you can switch back to the Free plan at any time. This will require users to pay their own protocol fees for subsequent transactions.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How are fees calculated?">
Protocol fees vary based on the source and destination chains, token being transferred, and current network conditions. View detailed fee breakdowns for each transaction in your Dashboard.
