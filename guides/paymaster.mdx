The Chainrails Paymaster enables you to sponsor protocol fees (bridging and swap fees) on behalf of your users, creating a seamless and frictionless payment experience for your application.

## What is a Paymaster?

Each cross-chain transaction on Chainrails incurs protocol fees to cover costs associated with bridges, AMMs and relayers. These fees are charged in the token being transferred, eliminating the need for users to hold multiple tokens for gas or fees.

## Getting Started

Here’s how to enable and use the Paymaster in your application:

### Step 1: Access the Dashboard

Navigate to the [Chainrails Dashboard](https://dashboard.chainrails.io) and go to the **Billing** section.

### Step 2: Choose Your Billing Plan

Chainrails offers three billing options to suit different use cases:

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Free Plan">
**Best for:** Use cases that's fine with users paying their own fees

- Users pay their own protocol fees
- No additional costs to you
- Easy to get started

</Tab>
<Tab title="Pay As You Go (PAYG)">
**Best for:** Growing applications with variable transaction volumes

- You pay protocol fees as transactions occur
- Only pay for what you use
- Requires manual balance management
- Real-time usage tracking in the Dashboard

<Warning>
Keep your paymaster balance funded to prevent transaction failures.
</Warning>

</Tab>
<Tab title="Monthly Subscription">
**Best for:** High-volume applications with predictable usage

- Fixed monthly fee with included transaction quota
- No manual paymaster management required
- Automatic overage handling
- Never worry about insufficient balance
- Best value for consistent usage

<Info>
Transactions beyond your monthly quota incur additional fees. View pricing details in the Dashboard.

</Tab>
</Tabs>

### Step 3: Enable the Paymaster

Once you select either **PAYG** or **Monthly Subscription**, the Paymaster is automatically enabled for your account. All transactions using your API key will have protocol fees covered.

## Using the Paymaster in Your Application

Once enabled, the Paymaster works automatically—no code changes required. Simply make transactions as usual:

PS: Ignore the `fees` field returned in intents as that is returned to track usage, but you would notice the `totalAmount` field is same as the `initialAmount` field, which means the user is not charged any additional fees.
