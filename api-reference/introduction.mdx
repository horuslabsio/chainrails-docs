## Overview
Chainrails exposes a RESTful API that allows developers to integrate cross-chain payment functionalities into their applications seamlessly. These API covers everything from requesting quotes, to creating and fulfilling payment intents.

## BASE URL
All API requests are made to the following base URL:
```
https://api.chainrails.io
```
## Authentication
All API requests require authentication using an API Key. You can include your API Key in the `Authorization` header as a Bearer token.
Example:
```Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY```

## Rate Limits
To ensure fair usage and maintain optimal performance, the Chainrails API enforces rate limits on incoming requests. The default rate limit is set to 250 requests per minute. If you exceed this limit, you will receive a `429 Too Many Requests` response. If you require higher rate limits, please contact the team.

## Testing the API
For testing purposes, we recommend using test keys and testnets. You can find more information about our supported testnets and tokens in the [Supported Networks & Tokens](/guides/integrations) guide.

**NB:** Due to bridge limitations, the minimum amount for test transactions is $1. Also note that some chains have no testnet support and for these you may need to use mainnet with small amounts.
