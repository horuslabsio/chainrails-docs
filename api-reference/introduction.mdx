## Overview
Chainrails exposes a RESTful API that allows developers to integrate cross-chain payment functionalities into their applications seamlessly. These API covers everything from requesting quotes, to creating and fulfilling payment intents.

## BASE URL
All API requests are made to the following base URL:
```
https://api.chainrails.io
```

## API endpoints

The API is organized into the following categories:

### Quotes

Handles fetching quotes from specific or multiple bridges:

1.  `GET /api/v1/quotes/single` - Get a quote from a specific bridge for a given route
2. `GET /api/v1/quotes/multiple` - Get quotes from all bridges for a specific route
3.  `GET /api/v1/quotes/best` - Get the best quote for a specific route
4.  `GET /api/v1/quotes/multi-source` - Get multiple source quotes for an intended destination chain

### Router

Manages the routing layer:

1.  `GET /api/v1/router/optimal-route` - Get the optimal route for a given intent
2. `GET /api/v1/router/supported-bridges/all` - List all supported bridges
3. `GET /api/v1/router/supported-bridges/route` - List supported bridges for a specific route
4. `GET /api/v1/router/supported-routes/bridge/{bridge}` - List supported routes for a specific bridge

### Intents

Handles creating and managing payment intents:

1.  `POST /api/v1/intents` - Create a new payment intent
2. ` GET /api/v1/intents` - Get all payment intents for a specific client (partners)
3. `GET /api/v1/intents/{intent_id}` - Get details of a specific payment intent
4. `GET /api/v1/intents/user/{sender}` - Get all payment intents for a specific user
5. `GET /api/v1/intents/address/{address}` - Get intent details by intent address
6. `GET /api/v1/intents/destination-address/{address}` - Precalculate the destination intent address for a specific intent
7. `PATCH /api/v1/intents/{id}/status` - Manually update the status of a specific payment intent

### Chains

Provides information about supported chains and tokens:

1.  `GET /api/v1/chains` - List all supported chains
2.  `GET /api/v1/chains/{chain}/tokens` - List all supported tokens for a specific chain

## Rate Limits
To ensure fair usage and maintain optimal performance, the Chainrails API enforces rate limits on incoming requests. The default rate limit is set to 250 requests per minute. If you exceed this limit, you will receive a `429 Too Many Requests` response. If you require higher rate limits, please contact the team.

## Testing the API
For testing purposes, we recommend using test keys and testnets. You can find more information about our supported testnets and tokens in the [Supported Networks & Tokens](/guides/integrations) guide.

**NB:** Due to bridge limitations, the minimum amount for test transactions is $1. Also note that some chains have no testnet support and for these you may need to use mainnet with small amounts.
